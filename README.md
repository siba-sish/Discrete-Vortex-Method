Contains the steady and unsteady cases Discrete Vortex Method(DVM) code for cambered and flat airfoil.

I had developed these codes for simulating the steady and unsteady flow conditions for single as well as multi-panel modelling of an airfoil on MATLAB. These codes were develped as a part of my summer fellowship.
Codes for specific cases present:-
Steady Multi-panel cambered airfoil
Steady single panel flat airfoil at an angle of attack
Steady multi-panel flat airfoil at an angle of attack
Unsteady multi-panel heaving flat airfoil at an angle of attack
