## Documentation
I had developed these codes for simulating the steady and transient flow conditions for single as well as multi-panel modelling of an airfoil on MATLAB. 
These codes were develped as a part of my JNCASR summer fellowship. 
Codes for specific cases present:- 
 - Steady flow over cambered airfoil.
 - Steady flow over single-panel flat airfoil.
 - Transient single-panel flat airfoil at an angle of attack.
 - Transient multi-panel flat airfoil at an angle of attack.
 - Transient multi-panel heaving flat airfoil at an angle of attack.
